# Reaktor Challenge 2021

#### [Assignment](https://www.reaktor.com/junior-dev-assignment-2021/)

### Overview

The deployed app can be found [here!](https://reaktor-challenge-2021.herokuapp.com) 

I used React for the web frontend and node only to fetch the rules.txt file and serve the static content to client. All text processing is done client side. 

__Note!__ The app is deployed through a node.js/express server in a free dyno Heroku and [the server goes to sleep after 30mins of inactivity](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/free-dyno-hours#dyno-sleeping) so the first time opening it takes a while. To see that the content loads fast please refresh the page.
